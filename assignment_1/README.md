This repository contains the source code (.ipynb files) and relevant resources for the Sydney Restaurant Success Prediction project, focusing on predicting restaurant ratings using various features. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression models, and a Tableau dashboard for visualization. The goal is to develop and evaluate different machine learning models, compare their performance, and provide insights on restaurant success factors. Additionally, this project includes the deployment of models using Docker and version control via GitHub, along with a list of useful commands and corresponding links.

## Project Overview
This project consists of the following tasks:

### **Part A: Importing and Understanding Data**
- Data Import and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations:
  - Interactive Plots
- **Tableau Dashboard**: [Tableau Dashboard Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rohit.baral/viz/tableau_part/Dashboard1) 

### **Part B: Predictive Modelling**
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Categorical Encoding using `MultiLabelBinarizer`
  - Scaling with `StandardScaler`
- **Regression Models:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R square
- **Classification Models:**
  - Logistic Regressor
  - Decion Tree
  - Random Forest
  - K-Neighbors Classifier  
  

### **Part C: Deployment**
- **Version Control with GitHub**
- **Containerization with Docker**
- **Model Deployment**: Scripts and configuration files for deploying the models using Docker.

## Files and Structure
- **`Assign_partA_DSTS.ipynb`**: Contains data import, preprocessing, EDA, and visualizations.
- **`Assign_partB_DSTS.ipynb`**: Feature engineering, regression models, and classification models.
- **`tableau_part.twb`**: Tableau workbook file for the visualization dashboard.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Docker configuration file to build and run the machine learning models in a containerized environment.
- **`Deliverables_u3268702.pdf`**: Detailed report of the project, including methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Tableau Dashboard
The **Tableau dashboard** visualizes insights related to the Sydney restaurant dataset, including restaurant ratings, location analysis, and cuisine type distribution. The dashboard provides interactive views for better decision-making.
